The next lecture in a high school requires two topics to be discussed. The i-th topic is interesting by ai units for the teacher and by bi units for the students.

The pair of topics i and j (i<j) is called good if ai+aj>bi+bj (i.e. it is more interesting for the teacher).

Your task is to find the number of good pairs of topics.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of topics.

The second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109), where ai is the interestingness of the i-th topic for the teacher.

The third line of the input contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤109), where bi is the interestingness of the i-th topic for the students.

Output
Print one integer — the number of good pairs of topic.
